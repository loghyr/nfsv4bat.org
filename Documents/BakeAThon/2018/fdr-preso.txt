	NFS Flight Data Recorder (FDR)


		A proposal for "always on" diagnosability mechanism for Linux NFS

		Bill.Baker@Oracle.com


	Rationale?


		Mr. Customer, can you reproduce that?

		Very frustrating for the Customer

			system crash

			data corruption

			blue moon bugs


	First Failure Data Capture


		FFDC: capture all data needed to diagnose on first occurrance

		kdump is a good example

		syslog also, but not a good choice for detailed FDR data 

			too noisy, too much in your face


	Requirements


		Always on (at least, when the modules get loaded)

		Very low overhead

		Circular, uninteresting data quietly thrown away

		Quiet until needed

			(unlike excessive syslog'ing)

		Consistent with existing coding practices (for NFS)


	Based on ftrace


		Meets the needs quite nicely

		ftrace instances

			private set of ftrace buffers (per cpu)

			no interference with global ftrace buffers

			probes enabled for just one particular instance

			created on the fly (see below)


	ftrace instances


		let X=/sys/kernel/debug/tracing

		created on the fly:

			mkdir $X/instances/nfs-fdr

		namespace populated with static probes

			ls $X/instances/nfs-fdr/events/nfs4
				... nfs4_write

		indvidual probes enabled like so

			echo 1 > $X/instances/nfs-fdr/events/nfs4/nfs4_write

		easily harvested

			cat $X/instances/nfs-fdr/trace_pipe

			kworker/37:1H-10775 [037] ....
			349553.408757: nfs4_write: error=1 (0x1) 
				fileid=00:31:8 fhandle=0x49af0c2f offset=0 count=1


	User space pieces


		New systemd service

			creates the FDR instance

			examines fdr config file to get probe names

				NB: this allows admin customization
				of which probes are to be enabled

			enable the probes


	Probe selection & naming


		How are "always on" probes earmarked?

			A: they aren't, this is a user space policy

			A': by naming convention

			existing ftrace probe:

				trace_nfs4_write(...);

			fdr probes

				fdr_nfs_thing(...);

		Why is this interesting?

			the fdr daemon can just readdir the relevant
			directories and enable the fdr probes, without
			having to update a config file or be aware of
			any new probes which might be 

		Even with this convention, still useful to have a config file

			The administrator can add other probes or disable
			some of the fdr probes which are too noisy or
			otherwise deemed uninteresting


	Issues


		Focus on content (the probes), not the mechanism

		More probes!  Smarter probes!

			Exceptional or unusual conditions

			Error mapping or errors masked (or handled)

			Latency bubbles

			more, more, more

		How do you retrieve unharvested probe data from a kdump?

			extensions to crash?  Yes!
