> FDR overview

	Flight Data Recorder by Bill.Baker@Oracle.com

		"always on" diagnosability mechanism for Linux

		Ideal for subsystems which have a rich set of ftrace probes
			like NFS & SUNRPC

		Focus on exception conditions, not FYI probes
			though, not a policy of FDR, per se

	What is FDR?

		A systemd daemon which:

			enables ftrace probes based on a config file

			captures the output and saves it to a file

			manages space consumption, logrotate(8)









> Where can I get this awesome tech?

	> Need to work with Steve Dickson to get this included in Fedora

	> Source has released to github

		https://github.com/oracle/fdr

		"Universal Permissive License" (UPL)

	> Download, build, customize, enjoy

> Next steps

	Get this into fedora, ultimately RHEL, OL

	Enhancements:

		eliminate modprobe keyword, hook into modprobe.d

		raw data capture, ala trace.dat, vs. textual output
